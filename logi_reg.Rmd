$\pi$ denotes the probability of observation being in specified category of the binary outcome.

$Logistic$ $regression$ models a relationship between predictor variables and  a $binary$, $multinomial$ or $ordinal$ response. Each case requires distinct logistic models. The current version of Analyzer only provides binary type, further versions may include more logistic models.

*Assumptions*

(for $binary$ logistic models)

* $Binary Response$: There must be only two possible responses.
* $Independence$: The observations must be independent of one another.
* $Linearity$: The logarithm of the odds ratio must be a linear function of $X$.

*Diagnostic*

* $Deviance$ tests.
* $\chi^{2}$ $goodness$-$of$-$fit$ tests.
